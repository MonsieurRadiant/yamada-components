            This Pok√©mon likes to lick its palms that are sweetened by being
            soaked in honey. Teddiursa concocts its own honey by blending fruits
            and pollen collected by Beedrill. Blastoise has water spouts that
            protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate.
